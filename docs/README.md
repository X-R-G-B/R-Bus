```
R-Type[a] is a horizontally scrolling shooter arcade video game developed
and released by Irem in 1987 and the first game in the R-Type series.
The player controls a star ship, the R-9 "Arrowhead", in its efforts to
destroy the Bydo, a powerful alien race bent on wiping out all of mankind.
The R-9 can acquire a glowing orbicular device called a "Force",
protecting it from enemy fire and providing additional firepower.
The arcade version was distributed by Nintendo in North America;
it is the last arcade title Nintendo distributed.
