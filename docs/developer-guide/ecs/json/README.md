# Json Class

## Introduction

The Json class provides ease in loading and accessing data from JSON files. Thanks to the Singleton design pattern, only one instance of this class exists and can be used all inside the program, preventing unnecessary reloading of files.

## Json library

We use the library of nlohmann called [json][json] used for modern C++. We choosed this library because of it's simplicity of usage and for the good features inside.
