## Introduction
The C++ client is a simple game client that uses the Raylib library to handle graphics and audio. The client is designed to be simple and easy to use, but it is also very flexible and can be used to create more complex games.

## Raylib Library
We use the Raylib library to handle our graphics and audio. Raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library that provides a wide range of features. The Raylib library is written in C, but we have wrapped it in C++ classes to make it easier to use.
